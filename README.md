# Advent of Code 2024 - My Lua Journey

[![Advent of Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Advent%20of%20Code-2024-blue)](https://adventofcode.com/2024)

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** project, where I explore the challenges of [Advent of Code]() while learning and practicing **Lua**. 🎄

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project is part of my journey to:

* **Learn Lua** through solving real-world problems.
* **Practice algorithms** and improve problem-solving skills.
* **Gather feedback** on my code to improve both my use of Lua and my approach to algorithms.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need:

* **Lua installed** on your system. You can download it from [lua.org](https://lua.org/]).

## 💻 How to Run

The project is organized into folders for each day of the challenge:

* Each day is in a folder named `dayX`, where `X` is the day number (e.g., `day1`, `day2`, etc.).
* Solutions to the problems are named `stepY.lua`, where `Y` is the step number (e.g., `step1.lua` for the first step, `step2.lua` for the second).
* Input files for each day's challenge are included in the respective folder as `input.txt`.
 
To run a solution for a specific step:

1.Navigate to the folder of the respective day:

```bash
cd dayX
```

2. Run the desired step file with Lua:

```bash
lua stepY.lua
```
The script will automatically use the provided input.txt file in the folder.

## 🌟 About Me & Contributing

I am a **beginner in Lua**, and this project is my opportunity to dive into the language while sharpening my algorithmic skills. I am open to:
- **Suggestions** to improve my code or approach.
- **Tips** on better utilizing Lua's features or optimizing my solutions.

If you'd like to actively contribute:
1. Open an **issue** to report bugs or suggest improvements.
2. Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a **pull request**.
3. Share feedback on my algorithm design or coding style.

All feedback is welcome as I continue to learn and grow!
